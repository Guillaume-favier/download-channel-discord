# download-channel-discord

## How to install ?

Get [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/) and then put the [`download-channel.plugin.js`](https://github.com/Guillaume-favier/download-channel-discord/blob/main/download-channel.plugin.js) and put it in your plug-in folder 

## How to use it ?

This is not very intuitive but for now this plus-in is only a test.

You need to install the plug-in, go on the channel that you want to download and then activate the plug-in. Next click on the `Click me!` button next to the text input and then wait and folow the instructions on the alert window.

## Where can you find me ?
